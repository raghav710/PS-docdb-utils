# Document DB cmdlets for Powershell

The aim of this repo is to provide all docDB management activities in a single module. As of now there is some support for docDB cmdlets and for some other tasks one has to go through some tiring [rest calls](https://russellyoung.net/2016/06/18/managing-documentdb-with-powershell/).

This repo aims to solve that.

As of now Document DB and collection creation are supported. Looking forward for volunteers to add new features!
